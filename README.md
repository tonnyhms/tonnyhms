- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Antonio Silva;
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer Science and Industrial Automation;
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development, computer science at UniFBV and watching Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science course.



 Hi... I'm an industrial automation technitian, but before I've been studying Computer Engineering at UPE. I know this isn't the best place to tell my story, but I believe it could help others that had their lives a little disturbed.
  I begun to get anxious before going to my classes... my body started to boycott myself, so I didn't have will to leave home anymore. I looked for some help, had some therapy sessions, went to a psychiatrist, had some medicine to hel me leave my comfort zone and started my automation technical course. At this course I met a friend that helped me with getting a job and now it makes me fell alive again. Finally I got back my body's control and am seeking to get my dev area back.
  
  If I could get my body control back, I can get whatever I want.
  
  And so can u.
